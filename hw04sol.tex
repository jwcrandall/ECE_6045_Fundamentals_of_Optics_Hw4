\textbf{Group 1} Design a Keplerian Beam expander (explain the difference and the advantages)

\textbf{Q&A} Describe your approach for building the system and its functionality.\\

\textbf{Q&A} After designing the optical system send to me a Bill of Costs including lenses (specifying type), beam splitters, mirrors, posts, holders, cages, stages. https://www.thorlabs.com/

\textbf{Specs Group 1-2} The system is not affected by chromatic aberration, the beam size has to be adjustable according to tunable focusing, Initial beam size of the laser $\SI{2}{m\metre}$.\\

Laser beam $d=2mm$, Camera Sensor $1/1.8$, and has to sense variation of the refractive index in the \SI{20}{m\second} regime. (specs on the sensor side)
